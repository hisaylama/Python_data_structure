    "A **Tree** is a data type that is ideal for representing hierarchial structure. Trees are composed of **nodes** and nodes have 0 or more **children** or **child nodes**. A node is called the parent of its children. Each node has (at most) one parent. If the children are ordered in soe way, then we have an ordered tree. We are concerned primamrily with rooted trees, i.e. ordered treees, i.e., there is a single special node called the **root** of the tree. The root is the only node that has no parents. The roots that do not have childrens are called leaf nodes.   "

We can give it a linear (sequential) structure by iterating through all the nodes in the tree, but there is not a unique way to do this.
